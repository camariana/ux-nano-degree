## Study 1: Semi-Structured Interview

### Background

I was in a van (a shared transport) going to West Field from Brikama. It's time to pay the fare, usually after the Airport junction, the apprentice proclaimed "pass"! One of the passengers sitting at my right side, gave the the apprentice D10, the apprentice ask him "Foi dem?" meaning where are you going? The passenger replied "Latrikunda", the apprentice looked at him with rage and said "pass bi D18 la deh". The passenger replied with a counter question "Hana pass bi nyatala Brikama bey Latrikunda?" The apprentice says "D18", the passenger said "deit, pass bi D10 la". 

While arguing, the passenger pull out a handout (six pages long, A4 papers) containing a tabular data of all the fares within the country. He flip through the pages scanning for the fare from Brikama to Latrikunda and after a couple of seconds, he pointed out to the apprentice "saytal, pass bi D10 la". The apprentice confirm, kept quite and return his change calmly.

After the scene, I asked the passenger, please may I have a look? He said "sure" and he handed me the handout. I looked at it and said to myself, in my mind "this should be turn into an app for people to quickly check the fare from one locality to another."

### Research Goal

Based on the background statement above, I want to turn the fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows passengers to quickly check the fare. And establish a single source of truth about how much to pay. 

- Learn where do people find out about the fare
- Learn whether is there a need to turn this into a digital solution.
- To determine what are the best ways  and needs for people to quickly lookup for fares, so that I can use these findings to help me shape the direction I take in designing the product.

### Research Questions

[Needs]

- Do people need a digital solution (web-based and/or mobile app) to know how much to pay and also receive notification when the fare changes?

[Behaviors]

- How do people usually learn what the fare is?
- When the government changes the fare, how do people know that?

### Method & Recruiting

#### Method

- Conduct a semi-structured 30 - 45  minute in-person interview to gather in-depth qualitative data.
- The researcher will use the interview script as a guide during the meeting and ask follow-up questions for clarification of some answers or particular findings discovered when organizing and analyzing that data.

#### Recruiting

- A recruiting email will be sent to friends and colleagues with a link for candidates to fill a short screener form. This will help the researcher to interview only passengers that have seen and/or use the fare handout.
- 3 participants, a mixture of adults and youths and use the public transport as means of traveling.

## Study 2: Survey

### Background

In the previous study, I learned that the fare handout is good but it is difficult to use and create a lot of confusion among the passengers, drivers and apprentices. To solves these problems,
