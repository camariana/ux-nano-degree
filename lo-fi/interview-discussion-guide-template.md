## Introduction Script

Thanks for taking some time to talk with us today. We are exploring a new opportunity to offer passengers to quickly look up for fares and get updates when the fare change by the Government. We also want to use it as a single source of truth to settle dispute between drivers/apparentice and passengers.

This phase of research is to explore and validate some of our assumptions around what this service will look like.

During this session, I’ll be asking you open-ended questions around your use of the fare handout and the public transportation system.

Everything you say will be kept strictly anonymous and confidential. 

There are no right or wrong answers to our questions! We want to understand how you
use the fare handout and the public transport system. Try to be as honest as possible, I promise, you won’t hurt my feelings.
