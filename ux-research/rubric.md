# UX Fundamentals & Design Research

Research Plan

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |

| Plan a research study, including research goals, recruiting criteria, and scripts. | The research plan is submitted as a PDF<br />The research plan includes:<br />A short paragraph to describe the background of the projectMain research goalsKey research questionsMethod: a brief explanation of how to apply the methodRecruiting criteriaThe list of interview/survey questionsNote: Be sure that your research goals are stated clearly and are reasonable in scope (don't try to squeeze too many things into one study). |
| Create interview guides that are designed to answer the research goals. | The script section has:An introduction sectionQuestions guideA brief wrap-up sectionEach interview question has its rationale written next to it |
| Design a survey to answer the research questions.            | Each survey question has its rationale written next to itThe formats of the survey questions are flexible; they can be multiple choice, Likert scales, ranking, etc. |

Research Report

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Write a research report to summarize the findings.           | The report has an executive summaryThe report has a brief description of background and study goalsKey findings are the main section of the reportThe report has recommendations/next stepsData has been collected and analyzed in Miro or with physical sticky notes; an image (can be a photo or screenshot) showing this data is attached to the appendix section of the report |
| Write a brief and informative executive summary.             | Executive summary has a brief description of the research projectExecutive summary summarizes key findings and recommendations |
| Present research findings supported by data and provide actionable recommendations or next steps. | Key findings are highlightedReport shows data to support findings (e.g., user quotes/observations)Report provides recommendations based on findings |

Design

| CRITERIA                                                     | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sketch out designs by hand, and improve a design based on design principles and research | Submission includes a design of at least one screen, which is drawn by hand or created using digital toolsThe design has annotations addressing: What is this design about? What are the key actions users can take?The design incorporates **at least one design principle** and **at least one key finding from the research report**Each screen has a short paragraph to explain the design rationale, and to explain which design principles and research findings were appliedOptionally, two iterations of the same design may be included, one of which is the "before" version (the original design) and one of which is the "after" version (the design that has been improved). |

## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

- Conduct additional rounds of research studies (interviews, surveys, diary studies, etc.) to gather more insights. For each interview study, try to interview at least 5 participants.
  Synthesize all the work into a single case study to showcase your UX design process.
- For the hand-drawn design, create a series of drawings for a task flow (instead of sketching only a single screen).
