# Shape the future of Google.

Tell us what you think about Google products and features by participating in our user research studies. You’ll get a token of our appreciation plus the chance to help build something you’ll love.

## Here’s how to get involved:

### 1. Sign up

Click the link below to sign up, and we’ll send you a questionnaire that will help our research team match you to particular studies. The more information you provide, the better your chances of being contacted by our team.

### 2. Participate

If we invite you to take part in a study, we’ll give you all the details about time, location, and method. Studies can take place in a Google office, our research van, or your home or business — or even online via your computer, smartphone, or tablet.

### 3. Get rewarded

Once your participation is complete, you’ll get a small thank-you gift like a gift card or a donation to your favorite charity. (We'll always tell you what the reward will be before you decide whether to participate.) You’ll also have our eternal gratitude for helping us make Google products the best they can be.

## We can’t wait to hear from you

If you're a potential match for an upcoming study, one of our research coordinators will send you a follow-up questionnaire and details about next steps. And if you're invited to participate, you'll work one-on-one with a Google researcher, either in a lab setting or your own space. Remember that there are no right or wrong answers — every bit of your feedback will help us improve the products we create.
