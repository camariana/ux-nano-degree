## Study 1: Semi-Structured Interview

### Background

I was in a van (a shared transport) going to West Field from Brikama. It's time to pay the fare, usually after the airport junction, the apprentice proclaimed "pass"! One of the passengers sitting at my right side, gave the the apprentice D10, the apprentice ask him "Foi dem?" meaning where are you going? The passenger replied "Latrikunda", the apprentice looked at him with rage and said "pass bi D18 la deh". The passenger replied with a counter question "Hana pass bi nyatala Brikama bey Latrikunda?" The apprentice says "D18", the passenger said "deit, pass bi D10 la". 

While arguing, the passenger pull out a handout (six pages long, A4 papers) containing a tabular data of all the fares within the country. He flip through the pages scanning for the fare from Brikama to Latrikunda and after a couple of seconds, he pointed out to the apprentice "saytal, pass bi D10 la". The apprentice confirm, kept quite and return his change calmly.

After the scene, I asked the passenger, please may I have a look? He said "sure" and he handed me the handout. I looked at it and said to myself, in my mind "this should be turn into an app for people to quickly check the fare from one locality to another."

### Research Goal

Based on the background statement above, I want to turn the fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows passengers to quickly check the fare and establish a single source of truth about how much to pay.

- Learn where do people find out about the fare
- Learn whether is there a need to turn the fare handout into a digital solution.

### Research Questions

[Needs]

- Do people need a digital solution (web-based and/or mobile app) to know how much to pay from one locality to the other.

[Behaviors]

- How do people usually learn what the fare is?
- When the government changes the fare, how do people know that?
- Do people ask each other what the fare is? Who and Why

[Pain points]

- What are the problems around the fare handout

### Method & Recruiting

#### Method

- Conduct a semi-structured 20 - 30  minute in-person interview to gather in-depth qualitative data.
- The researcher will use the interview script as a guide during the meeting and ask follow-up questions for clarification of some answers or particular findings discovered when organizing and analyzing that data.

#### Recruiting

- A recruiting email will be sent to friends and colleagues with a link for candidates to fill a short screener form. This will help the researcher to interview only passengers that have seen, know, and/or use the fare handout.
- 4 participants, a mixture of adults and youths and use the public transport as means of traveling.

#### Screening Questions

1. What is your fullname? [*to know who fill the form*]

2. ------, how do you know the fare from one locality to the other?

   ​	a. I ask other passengers

   ​	c. From the fare handout
   
3. Do you know that a fare handout exist that list out all the fares from one locality to the other within the country?

   ​	a. Yes

**Warm-up questions**:

1. Which areas do you travel the most often?

**Needs and behaviors:**

## Study 2: Survey

### Background

In the previous study, I learned that the fare handout is used to settle disputes among users, and a reference point for users.  But on the other hand, it is difficult to use and creates a lot of confusion among the passengers, drivers and apprentices due to different users having different copies of the handout. To solves these problems, I also  learned that there is a great need to turn the fare handout into an app (web or mobile), but more data is needed to better understand the needs and whether they generalize to the larger population of the passengers.

### Research Goal

This study focuses on better understanding users needs related to turning the fare handout into an app (web or mobile) and to determine what are the best ways  and needs for passengers to quickly check the fare when traveling and/or in the middle of a conflict with a driver/apprentice, as well as better measuring the extent to which these needs are held by the majority of the  passengers.

### Research Questions

How can passengers quickly check how much to pay from one locality to the other, particularly when traveling?

- Which features/functions are useful?

- Use surveys to collect data from at least 30 passengers
- Test survey questions with 5 volunteers, my friends and colleagues.
