## Annotated Iteration based on Data & KPIs

|                            | Goals                                                        | Signals                                                      | Metrics                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Increase Task success rate | Users to be able to quickly search for a fare on the long list of all fares page | Takes times for users to check the fare on the all fares list page | The times it takes for them to scroll to find the fare they are looking for. |
|                            |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |

- All most 100% of the users cannot quickly check for the fare on the ALL FARES page because it takes time to scroll to find the fare they are looking for.
