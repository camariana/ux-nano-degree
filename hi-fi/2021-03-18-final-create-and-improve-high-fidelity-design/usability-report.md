# PASSO - Usability Testing

## Executive Summary

### Background

The Ministry of Transportation created and distributed a fare handout listing all the fares in the country; Base on the background in my research plan, users (passengers and drivers/apprentice) used the fare handout as a single source of truth to settle disputes among themselves. But the handout, in turn, causes more problems due to the following reasons:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

- Different users have different copies of the handout.
- The fare handout is six pages long; checking the fare from one locality to the other takes time.
- You can't carry it all the time.
- 30% of the passengers don't know a fare handout exists from the Ministry.

I want to help the Ministry by turning the six pages fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows users to check the fare from one place to another.

## Goal

The goal of this study was to test the usability of PASSO with users who frequently use the public transport system as primary means of travelling.

## Task Given

1. Search for a fare 
2. See ALL FARES page
3. Browse through all fares page

## Participants

Recruited 3 users using lookback



## Key insighhts

### Frustration

One of the participants don't know what PASSO is and ask for a beter introduction to the app.

### Pain Point/s

Takes time to scroll through the ALL FARES page to check for a fare

### Delight

The rest of the participants are able to search for a fare and happily see the results expected simply and quickly.
