# Exercise: Hand-off

You’ve just started a new app project at work and you are about to have a kickoff meeting with engineers. You don’t know much about the app but you know that it’s set to service a wide demographic of users in: age, gender, occupation, and education. You want to take leadership and bring the designers perspective to the table. You present a few ideas, but the engineers aren’t happy with them. In a Google doc, write bullet point notes on what questions you would ask the engineers to get the best feedback on your work.

**Keep in mind the following things you’ve learned**:

- Feedback is always a positive thing
- Keep the lines of communication open
- Be humble about your work
- Don't forget to take notes
- Socialize your work from the ideation phase
- Ask great questions - One of your greatest tools
- Accessibility (WCAG - A,AA,AAA)

## Solution

Here are my questions from the video - remember, there are many potential options here!

- Thank you for your feedback, what are your thoughts on how the design could be improved?
- Are there any domain experts we can talk to on the topic that would have valuable information to offer us?
- What are your thoughts on putting together a design sprint to get a variety of ideas for how to approach this to kick things off?
- How might we implement user testing at the appropriate time so that we are making sure we are building what users really want?
- Do we have any existing data that we can leverage?
- Seeing that our app will service a large demographic, what considerations are we giving to accessibility to accommodate people with special needs?

# Exercise: User Stories

Create 3 user stories in a Google doc with the formatting you learned.

Hint: User Role, Goal and Benefit



#### Accessibility

Designing products to be capable of use by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities that make regular use through audio or visual means difficult. Adjusting font sizes, providing strong color contrast for copy, using subtitles on video, and making sure buttons are large enough are just some of the ways to make a design more accessible.

#### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

A set of guidelines for accessibility on the web, with the goal to provide a universal standard everyone can follow for accessible web design.

#### WCAG Principles

- ##### Perceivable

  - Information on the site needs to be able to be perceived

- ##### Operable

  - The interface needs to be in operation and functional

- ##### Understandable

  - The interface should be understandable

- ##### Robust

  - The interface's content needs to be robust enough so that it can be consumed by a variety of sources, such as screen readers.

#### WCAG rating system: A, AA, AAA

WCAG also has a way of rating how well sites are doing on the WCAG Principles by providing a letter A (the lowest), AA (in the middle) and AAA (the highest rating).

#### WebAIM *(Tool)*

An accessibility tool that allows you to perform color and contrast checks on your designs, as well as tweak your color choices directly in the tool. The tool is able to provide an accessibility rating for your design.

#### Zeplin *(Tool)*

A design handoff tool to help facilitate the workflow between designers and engineers. You can import your designs from Figma and it can easily turn your designs into a style guide to be used in production.

#### Project Density

Creating designs that can work with different pixel densities based on devices of different sizes and resolutions. With project density, it’s good practice to give engineers images at 2x and 3x resolution along with the standard image to help with higher resolutions.

#### Hand off

Hand off to engineers involves a number of deliverables, including user stories, task flow, and handling feedback from engineers.

#### User stories

A UX method that allows you to create a scenario, based on research, that reflects the life of your ideal user and how they will interact with your application. Set up as:

> ```
> As a <user role>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>.
> ```

#### Task flow

Somewhat similar to a user flow, but instead shows high level processes your user takes to accomplish their goal, such as how they navigate an application. This can help uncover roadblocks in the actions you want users to perform.

#### Whimsical *(Tool)*

A design tool that can help with task flows and user journeys.

#### Engineer feedback tips

Designers don’t work alone, but often in teams with people with a variety of skill sets to execute the overall vision of a product. While taking even constructive criticism can sometimes be difficult, remember: 1) feedback is always a positive thing; 2) keep the lines of communication open; 3) be humble about your work; 4) don’t forget to take notes; 5) separate your work from the ideation phase; and 6) ask great questions - one of the most important parts!













Correct! Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) allow you to measure the impact of your product on a broad scale and then use that data to make informed decisions about the direction of the product. Next, let’s test what you’ve learned about choosing the right Metrics with Google’s HEART Framework!

Correct! Follow the HEART Framework using the Goals-Signals-Metrics process. Goals are what the user wants to accomplish. Signals are where you will find the data to verify goal achievement. Metrics are indicators of user success itself. As we proceed, you'll learn which UX Analytics Tools to leverage for tracking specific Metrics!
