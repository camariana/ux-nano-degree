# Passengers:

## Their hopes dreams

**UX Researcher: A. Camariana, January 2021**



## Executive Summary

Since this type of product has never been build before, I want to validate the need for designing and developing an an experience that allows passengers to quickly check the fare and also establish a single source of truth about how much to pay. I interviewed 4 passengers on their difficulties with the current fare handout and whether there is a need to turn the fare handout into an app.

### Key Findings

- The fare handout is bulky and it takes time to check the fare because you to have to flip through the pages to check the fare
- Different users (passenger, drivers etc) have different copies of the fare handout, this create a lot confusion between passengers and drivers.
- The fare handout is not widely spread so a lot people don't even know it exists

## What did I want to learn?

I wanted to find out what are the difficulties around the fare handout and also validate the need in turning it into app. 

### Key Research Questions

[Needs]

- Do people need a digital solution (web-based and/or mobile app) to know how much to pay and also receive notification when the fare changes?

[Behaviors]

- How do people usually learn what the fare is?
- When the government changes the fare, how do people know that?
