# Passengers:

## Their pain points and dreams

**UX Researcher: A. Camariana, January 2021**



## Executive Summary

Since this type of product has never been build before, I want to validate the need for designing and developing an an experience that allows passengers to quickly check the fare and also establish a single source of truth about how much to pay. I interviewed 4 passengers on their difficulties with the current fare handout and whether there is a need to turn the fare handout into an app.

### Key Findings

- The fare handout is bulky and it takes time to check the fare because you to have to flip through the pages to check the fare
- Different users (passenger, drivers etc) have different copies of the fare handout, this create a lot confusion between passengers and drivers.
- The fare handout is not widely spread so a lot people don't even know it exists

## What did I want to learn?

I wanted to find out what are the difficulties around the fare handout and also validate the need in turning it into app. 

### Key Research Questions

[Needs]

- Do people need a digital solution (web-based and/or mobile app) to know how much to pay and also receive notification when the fare changes?

[Behaviors]

- How do people usually learn what the fare is?
- When the government changes the fare, how do people know that?

## 4 Participants

I recruited my friends and colleagues as participants

| #    | Type of Transport use frequently | Locality   |      |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------- | ---- |
| P1   | Van                              | Banjul     |      |
| P2   | Gelegele                         | Serrekunda |      |
| P3   | Van                              | Brikama    |      |
| P4   | Taxi                             | Brusubi    |      |

**Key finding 1**

## Passengers keep the handout to settle disputes with the drivers and or apprentice

 *Finding*

With all the difficulties around the fare handout, participants always keep a coy of the handout in other to refer to it when someone ask them about the fare and/or use it to settle disputes with the drivers and or apprentice

> I kept the copy of the handout because when ever I traveled to new destinations, I refer to it and also use it to settle disputes and set the record straight for drivers and apprentice that escalate the fare.
>
> Participant 2

## Recommendations

To have a single and updated source of truth concerning the fare, the fare handout should be turn into an app (web or mobile).

Things to consider:

- Make it available offline
- notify users (all users - drivers, passengers etc) when the fare changes to avoid conflicts



**Key finding 2**

## Passengers have difficulties in using the handout, especially quickly checking the fare from one place to the other.

 *Finding*

The hand is bulky, checking the fare from one locality to the other takes time and the handout is not list/group in way that user can check things up quickly 

> The handout is not divided according to regions or destinations. That makes it difficult to use
>
> Participant 4

> The handout is difficult to look up for fares, you keep looking until you look funny
>
> Participant 2

## Recommendations

When the fare handout is turned into app, it should be very easy for all users to quickly search for the fare and the fare listing page should be categories by regions.

Things to consider:

- Allow users to filter by regions
- Have an easy listing of the fare

## Next Steps

- Validate findings with surveys
- Run a design sprint for brainstorming



## Data collection and analysis
