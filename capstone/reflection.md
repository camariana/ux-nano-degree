With PASSO, the goal was to help the Ministry by turning the six pages fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows users to check the fare from one place to another. 

My design process was from UX research,  concept and prototyping, testing and final solutions. I use a technique called **affinity mapping** (with miro) to gather all of the insights, cluster similar thoughts together, and named the clusters into themes. This process helps me see what exists across various users and various types of data and draw patterns to generate meaningful solutions. One of the main findings during research was "with all the problems around the fare handout, passengers always kept a copy of the fare handout to refer to it to settle disputes with the drivers or apprentices". From the themes, I have identified a few opportunity areas. For example, "How do users get updated about the fare?" has a great opportunity because there is no single source of truth of the fare handout.

Finally, I came up with a single **How might we** question. **How might we** provide a digital single and updated source of truth for passengers so they can quickly check the fare (know how much to pay) from one locality to the other?

After having some opportunity areas, I use the Value Vs. Complexity Quadrant to prioritization three features to implement. 

Outputs from synthesis gave me a clear problem definition. Next up, I started sketching on paper to demonstrate the ideas of user's needs. Up next, I move on to do the final sketches into low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. After having some views, I define a user flow to see the steps a user takes through to complete tasks.

After defining possible user flows, I created a simple clickable prototype (using Figma) based on the states of the flow.

I took the insights from the usability testing and went back to refine my designs until it finally clicks.
