## Problem Overview

The Ministry of Transportation created and distributed a fare handout listing all the fares in the country; Base on the background in my research plan, users (passengers and drivers/apprentice) used the fare handout as a single source of truth to settle disputes among themselves. But the handout, in turn, causes more problems due to the following reasons:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

- Different users have different copies of the handout.
- The fare handout is six pages long; checking the fare from one locality to the other takes time.
- You can't carry it all the time.
- 30% of the passengers don't know a fare handout exists from the Ministry.

[The image of the exiting handout here]

I want to help the Ministry by turning the six pages fare handout into a digital solution by designing an experience that allows users to check the fare from one place to another.



## Discovery: Research & Analysis

Before jumping into drawing screens, I want to be sure that I'm addressing the user's needs and unpack the insights; I have crafted a research plan and conducted in-person and phone interviews with peoples who regularly use the public transportation system.

[Participants and their data - the table in the research report]

[picture here interviewing press/faal]

Notes over image -> *Interviewed 5 participants across different regions.*

I used **active listening** to condense all of the respondent's data into atomic nuggets that are easy to understand.

[notes on sticky pad picture on the table]

### Key Finding

With all the problems around the fare handout, passengers always
kept a copy of the fare handout to refer to it to settle disputes with the drivers or apprentices.



> I kept a copy of the fare handout because whenever I traveled to new destinations, I refer to it and also use it to settle disputes and set the record straight for drivers and apprentice that escalate the fare.
> 
> Participant 2

### Persona

I created a persona to understand users' needs and pain points.

## Design: Concepts & Sketching

After completing active listening, I use a technique called **affinity mapping** (with miro) to gather all of the insights, cluster similar thoughts together, and named the clusters into themes. This process helps me see what exists across various users and various types of data and draw patterns to generate meaningful solutions.

[Discovering themes names diagram]  

From the themes, I have identified a few opportunity areas. For example, "How do users get updated about the fare?" has a great opportunity because there is no single source of truth of the fare handout.

[problem finding diagram] 

Finally, I came up with a single **How might we** question. **How might we** provide a digital single and updated source of truth for passengers so they can quickly check the fare (know how much to pay) from one locality to the other?

### Feature Ideation

I used the **Crazy-8** technique to focus my creativity and came up with some wild ideas on paper.

| 08   | Personalization & contribution | A WhatsApp widget for live chat with authorities concerning disputes and for the authorities to take measures to solve it |

### Feature Prioritization

After having some opportunity areas, I use the Value Vs. Complexity Quadrant to prioritization three features to implement.

 [Value Vs. Complexity Quadrant diagram]

Based on the feature ideation and prioritization, the challenge for this project was to design:

1. A simple, easy, and quickest way for users to search how much the fare is. 
2. A clear and filterable listing of all the fares with different vehicle types, localities with regions within the country. 
3. A back office for the authorities to add new users, new localities and update the fares. 

### Paper Sketches

Outputs from synthesis gave me a clear problem definition. Next up, I started sketching on paper to demonstrate the ideas of user's needs.

[final paper sketches]

### Low-fidelity Wireframes

Up next, I move on to do the final sketches into low-fidelity wireframes using figma.

[Lo-fi Wire frames]

### User Flow

After having some views, I define a user flow (from start to finish and all the different directions they can take) to see the steps a user takes through to complete tasks. Here, I've shown the flow a user takes to search for a fare and a link to all fares.

[flow chat diagram]

## Develop: Prototyping

After defining possible user flows, I created a simple clickable prototype (using figma) based on the states of the flow to test with the users.

[prototype mockup gif here]

## Testing: Validation

I learned the following from the usability study:

- The user was confused with the two fare results page
- On the ALL FARES page, the user couldn't determine the fare is for which vehicle type.

When I conducted further usability studies, other issues also were discovered. For example, nearly 100% of the users cannot quickly check for the fare on the ALL FARES page because it takes time to scroll to find the fare they are checking up.

## Design: Iteration

I took the insights from the usability testing and went back to refine my designs.
