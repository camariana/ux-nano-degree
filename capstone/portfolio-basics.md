# Humanist. Strategist. Coach.

Only 11% of global leaders believe they know how to build organizations for the future.

Blending a background in interdisciplinary social sciences, strategic design, and foresight/futures, I partner with global clients to create solutions for thriving workplace cultures and empowered talent. With over a decade in the tech sector, I've consulted for global companies and startups in advancing initiatives in innovation, digital transformation, and people experiences (employee, partner, customer). Bringing a rich sense of humanity, deliberativeness, and orchestration to every engagement is absolutely essential. 

I'm the founder and principal at Context Leap, a people and culture development firm that focuses on fresh perspectives and practical approaches to preparing people and organizations for the future.

Accepting coaching and consulting clients for 2019. 

How can I help?

**Skills and expertise**





For me, the most important major take aways are: focus on the core task flow, always validate the design solutions before you jump into drawing screens, collect your own data, understand your users, don't just copy your competitor, and design with data in mind. 

**What makes a good portfolio:**

- 4 to 6 recent and relevant projects focused on quality
- Reflects your skills, experience, and knowledge
- Showcases your personal brand
- Easy to read, use, and navigate

**What to consider when selecting a case study:**

- Complete or logical design process
- Reflects key core skills, tools, and activities
- Strong connection between solution and challenge
- Compelling reflection on the results or outcomes

**Process for creating a project case study:**

- Collect and organize your project process and artifacts
- Create a content and assets inventory
- Reflect on the project story
- Articulate the key challenge
- Select key insights, decisions, challenges, and opportunities to discuss
- Discuss the solution and impact
- Design a case study layout/format

**Finalizing Your Case Study:**

- Get feedback on your portfolio content and design
  - Aim for at least 2-3 reviewers
- Summarize and prioritize the feedback
- Revise and iterate accordingly

**Completing Final Portfolio Checks:**

- Is all of your content properly transferred and in the place?

Good Portfolio Maintenance:

- Include 4-6 project case studies in your portfolio

- Apply your own approach to maintaining versions of your portfolio
- Archive old projects (but don’t delete them)
