**My comment for this course**

For me, the most important major take aways are: focus on the core task flow, always validate the design solutions before you jump into drawing screens, collect your own data, understand your users, don't just copy your competitor, and design with data in mind.

Here's a quick summary of the main topics we'll be covering in this course:

In the first lesson, **UX: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly**, we'll start off with some UX basics:

- What makes for a **good user experience**?
- What are some **principles we can use to quickly evaluate a design**?
- What are some **ways of thinking** that will help us design better?
- How do we **select a good design problem**?

In the second lesson, **Research First**, we'll talk about why research matters, and we'll go over the actual process of conducting a study and reporting the results:

- How to create a **research plan**
- How to **recruit participants**
- How to conduct a **semi-structured interview study**
- How to conduct a **survey study**, including how to ask effective survey questions
- How to **analyze data**
- How to **create a report**

In the third lesson, **Design for Humans**, we'll tour some psychological principles that we can apply to our designs, such as:

- How **peripheral vision** affects the user experience
- How **gestalt**, or the grouping of objects, affects the user experience
- The importance of considering **emotional design** in our products In this lesson, we'll also get some practice applying the principles we've learned to our design sketches.

Throughout all of the lessons, you'll be getting hands-on experience with these concepts by applying what you learn to your own project—so let's talk about that next.







In summary, here are all the main things you'll do for your project:

- Select a design problem (you'll be able to select your own design problem or, if you prefer, use a pre-defined *Coffee Shop* problem that we provide)
- Create a research plan
- Write interview questions
- Recruit participants for an interview study
- Run the interview study
- Organize and analyze the data from your interviews
- Create a research report
- Run a survey study
- Sketch a design for at least one screen of your product (based on your research findings and the design principles you've learned)

In the end, you'll submit three main things: A research plan, a research report, and a design sketch. If you want to get an idea of what those will look like, you can check out examples here:

- [Example research plan](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da657d1_example-research-plan/example-research-plan.pdf)
- [Example research report](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da65823_example-research-report/example-research-report.pdf)
- [Example design sketch](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da65bef_example-design-sketch/example-design-sketch.pdf)

You can also get these examples at any time from the **Resources** section on the left.

Now that you know where we are headed, let's get started!







## What is UX design?

When I tell people that I'm a UX designer, my friends say, “so you draw pictures”. My technical friends say, “so you write front-end”. And my co-workers say, “so you make things pretty”.

No! UX design is much more than just making things pretty, drawing pictures, or laying out a User Interface (UI). UX designers (often called "UXers") also spend a lot of time doing research, uncovering user needs, and coming up with design solutions that follow fundamental psychological principles.



> UX Design is about using design thinking to solve problems.



When you are doing shopping on Amazon, have you ever wondered why the shopping cart is called “shopping cart”? Why is the shopping cart on the top right corner of the page? Why does the home page list some things but not others? Why are some fonts bold and black and large, while other fonts are gray and small? There is deliberation behind every design detail.

In this lesson, we'll start to consider questions like these, and begin practicing how to think like a designer.

To be specific, we will:

- Ask the question, **what is good UX?** We'll look at some concrete examples of different products and interfaces, and consider what might make them good (or bad) experiences for users.
- Consider some **rule-of-thumb principles or \*heuristics\*** that we can use to quickly evaluate a design.
- Look at what it means to **design with users in mind** and to **design with data in mind**.
- Talk about how and when to do **competitive analysis**.

We've created a PDF reference sheet to help you remember some of the key terms and concepts from this lesson. You can download it [here](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da35a23_uxnd-reference-cheet-c1l1-ux-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/uxnd-reference-cheet-c1l1-ux-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.pdf), or at any time by going to the Resource section on the left.

Let's get started!





> ## A note on critiquing designs
>
> In the video, I poked fun at the aesthetics of Microsoft Word and Google Docs. But to be clear, my goal is not to say that these are bad tools or that they are poorly designed—they are both incredibly powerful word processors, and the aesthetics are only one aspect.
>
> When we evaluate the design of a product, the look and feel are just one of many criteria—and furthermore, how someone responds to that look and feel may differ greatly from one user to the next. In the video, I was taking the perspective of a user who doesn't need any advanced features in their word processor. For a user like that, they may just need the ability to type up an article, and the many powerful and complex features offered by some apps won't really provide any value (and may even detract from the experience).
>
> Throughout this course, we will look at examples of designs, and I will critique different aspects of them in terms of how they affect the user experience. We'll also talk about the importance of knowing who your users are, so that you know who you are designing for and what matters to them! The goal in all of this is not to slam a company or a product. Rather, I want to get you thinking both about who your target users are, and how different design decisions can have dramatic effects on those users experiences.



## Good UX…

To recap the key points from the video, good UX design:

### 1. Is usable

Users should be able to learn how to use the product easily.

### 2. Is aesthetically pleasing

Good design is aesthetically pleasing to look at. In fact, users will even tend to feel a design is more usable simply because it is more aesthetically pleasing—a phenomenon called the [aesthetic-usability effect](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/).

### 3. Delights the user

The design brings the user nice surprises. It’s like getting a gift for St. Patrick’s day—you didn’t expect it, but you're happy (delighted!) to receive it.





## How to conduct heuristic evaluation

Heuristic evaluation is something you can do at any time, with no funds, resources, or help from others, and without following a strict, formal process. That said, you'll likely get more out of your evaluation if you take the steps outlined in the above video and below:

- **Find 3–5 experts.** These should be people who know about usability principles and are familiar with the product.
- **Come up with heuristics as a team.** You can adapt Nielsen’s heuristics to fit your product.
- **Identify tasks.** What are the critical user journeys? For example: For an online shopping site, one critical user journey could be *how to purchase an item*.
- **Conduct individual evaluations.** Have each expert evaluate the design separately. You can use a spreadsheet or a doc to track all the issues. List out each issue and identify how severe it is. For severity, you can use a point-system (5 is super severe, 1 is not really an issue) or use “critical” “major issue” “minor issue” and “cosmetic issue”.
- **Aggregate results.** Pool the results from the individual evaluations. What does the team agree on?

## You Are Not Your User

One of the most important concepts of UX, you are not your user. 

Tell users what they need to know. Be upfront and straightforward



---

As designers, we have a tendency to assume that our users are similar to us. In fact, this isn't just a problem that designers have—it is an example of a more general phenomenon, called the [false-consensus effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect). As human beings, we often have a tendency to assume others are more similar to us than they really are. For example, when we react a certain way to a design, we may assume others will react the same way. In other words, we may assume there is an agreement or *consensus* when there is none (thus the name, *false consensus*)



Remember, users are humans beings! If you want to be kind to your users, you should think twice before doing any of the following:

- **Forcing** users to do things they don't want
- Using **manipulinks** to make users feel bad about declining an offer
- Using **urgency** to prevent users from spending time thinking about a decision
- Using **obnoxious stimuli** (like annoying sounds) to get a user to do something
- Using misleading **"clickbait" titles** and **false alarms** to get a user to click on something





## A note on consumer-facing products vs. enterprise products

By now, we've looked at a bunch of different examples of products, and I've critiqued different features of their UX design. I want to note that the examples I chose for this course are all consumer-facing products, such as Snapchat, Pinterest, and so on. Consumer-facing products generally have good UX because it’s a very competitive market. Consumer-facing teams usually invest heavily in UX and conduct A/B tests to optimize their sites. So some of the issues I've critiqued here are relatively minor.

In comparison, you should be aware that many enterprise products have very bad UX problems. There are a few reasons why this tends to be the case:

- Enterprise products are sold to the company management team and not the users. Enterprise users can’t ditch a product because of bad UX. For instance, if your company decides to use *Concur* for expenses, then you have no choice but to use *Concur*.
- Many enterprise products have complex business logic. A product to manage the supply chain of a company is more complex than photo-sharing.
- Enterprise products require users to have certain specific domain knowledge.

Of course, it is not a universal rule that enterprise products have worse design than consumer-facing products—but these are some factors you should be aware of.

## Design with Users in Mind

When designing, you want to keep the user—not your ego—at the center of your thinking. The goal is not just to engage in design, but to engage in **user-centered design**. And we want to go behind just thinking about, or imagining, our target user—we also must build our design processes such that they gather valid data on who our users *really* are and what they *actually* need (rather than what we imagine they need). And when we do have to make assumptions about our users (which we often do), we should be mindful of these assumptions, rather than proceeding as if we already know they are correct

## Quick Design Sketch

Who are our users?
What do they need?

When we create a design, we inevitably make decisions about that design that are based on what we think our users are like and what we think they want. Two people, given the same design problem, may create very different designs, depending on who they think the users will be.

To see this in action, let's do a quick design sketch!

my sketches are on my book

### Sketching with users in mind

Remember, your sketches don't need to look pretty. Again, the purpose of this exercise was to get you thinking about those two questions:

**Who are our users?**
**What do they need?**

Even if we don't consciously think about these questions, we still have to make decisions about them when we are sketching a design. It will help you make better sketches—and understand your sketches better—if you have these questions in mind and are making a deliberate effort to answer them. Again, our goal is to *design with users in mind*!

## How to Select a Design Problem



The first step that goes into UX design is selecting a design problem that you want to tackle. Selecting a good problem is a skill all by itself, so let's look at some of the things you should keep in mind when choosing the problem you're going to research.

## Scope

When selecting a problem, it's really important to make sure you're choosing something that is do-able. You'll want to make sure:

- That you have access to the participants you need
- That the problem is relatively narrow in scope; don't pick a problem that is too general or too large

## Example: Textbook App

Let's look at some more examples, so that we can get some practice thinking about the scope of a design problem.

A mobile app for college students to trade textbooks

The above sound like a good scope, but

Focus on 1 user group

Choose a specific type of user

- Buyers
  - Browse, search by courses, look at book details
- Sellers
  - List books, set up price

Then focus on 1 task flow

Only focus on a core task flow

- sign-up flow
- on-boarding experience
- Browsing books and looking at book details
- scheduling a time and place to meet for the trade
- setting & privacy

It is important to focus on the core task flow, so in the above list that would be "Browsing books and looking at book details"

---

Remember, when scoping your design problem, it will help if you focus on:

- One user group
- One core task flow

In the example we just looked at, this design problem has way too broad a scope:

> Build an app for college students to trade textbooks.

This encompasses multiple user groups (e.g., buyers vs. sellers) and multiple tasks (browsing books, posting books for sale, etc.).

Whereas this is far more specific and achievable:

> Within a textbook-trading app, build an experience that allows buyers to browse books and look at book details.

Again, notice that this states a more specific user group (buyers) and targets a single task flow (browsing books/book details).

## More examples

Samples

- (Too big) Solve the world's hunger problem
- (Too generic) make online shopping easy:
  - Online shoe shopping?
  - Online grocery shopping?
- (Too many different types of users) A platform for food delivery:
  - Customers
  - Restaurants
  - Delivery people



In the end, there isn’t really a wrong design topic. If you have time, you are free to choose a larger scope, design for more than one user group, and focus on multiple user journeys. But you should be aware of how these things will impact your time and the do-ability of your study—so that's why we are encouraging you to think about them when deciding what to do for your project.





## Select Your Design Problem



It's time to think about what you want to do for your final project! The first step is to choose a problem or need that you're interested in solving for. This could be essentially anything you like, as long as it can be addressed by an application (specifically, an app that could run on mobile phone or web platforms).

In choosing the overall design space, you have two general options: You can either select a predefined problem (Option 1) or choose your own (Option 2).

### Option 1: The Udacity Coffee Shop app

Udacity is considering opening a digitally-enabled coffee shop experience. As part of this experience, students will be able to use an app (mobile or web-based), which exists separately from the Udacity classroom, to perform actions such as:

- Placing their drink orders
- Collaborating with other students in the coffee shop
- Motivating progress on a Nanodegree
- Facilitating a productive study environment

It is up to you to choose specific features that you want to implement, but they must address one or more of these core design needs.

This option will be a little easier, in the sense that the problem space has already been defined for you—although you'll still need to narrow down on a specific aspect of that problem space. On the other hand, you will be tackling the same problem as many of your fellow students, so your project will not be as unique as if you go with Option 2.

### Option 2: Select your own design problem

Find a problem space that you are interested in. Is there an application you wish you had, but that does not yet exist? It can be about pretty much anything—such as vacation planning, a dry cleaning pick-up service, or a comic book trading platform.

Selecting your own design problem is a little more challenging, but it has a few benefits. First, the process of selecting a good problem is itself an important skill to have as a UX designer, so this will give you additional practice with that skill. And second, you'll generate a project that is totally unique, and that no other students have done. This can potentially be developed into a strong portfolio piece—so if creating an awesome portfolio piece is one of your goals, then selecting your own problem might be the way to go.



## Scoping the topic

Whichever option you go with, you'll still need to narrow in on a specific aspect of the problem. One of the biggest risks in tackling a design problem is choosing a problem that is too big. Especially when you have limited time and resources (like you do for this project), it's important to land on a topic that has an appropriate scope and won't become overwhelming or impossible to get done.

#### Example

Here's an example of the decision process for selecting a topic and narrowing the scope. At each step, we make a choice about which option we want to pursue (the chosen options are shown here in italics).

1. Choose a domain/industry
   - *Food ordering*, online learning, buying shoes online, etc.
2. Choose a more niche market
   - Food ordering → *ordering pizza from a pizza chain*
3. Choose a user group (only one)
   - Who are the users of a pizza ordering app?
     - Chefs who need to track incoming orders
     - Pizza delivery man
     - Store managers who want to see sales
     - *Customers*
4. Narrow down the users
   - Office managers who buy 20 pizzas for a company party
   - People who want to eat pizza inside the pizza shop
   - *College students who just want to order a pizza delivery*
5. Choose a single critical user journey
   - Sign-up for the app
   - Set up payment
   - *Choose a pizza*
   - Check delivery time

**The final scope:** *Design an app for college students to order pizza.*

You'll want to go through a similar process for your project to narrow down the scope of your design problem. As you work on this, it may help to create a diagram showing possible users and subjects you could target. Below is an example, which I created with [Whimsical.com](https://whimsical.com/). You can use any tool you like for this process (e.g., digital tools, pen and paper, whiteboard, etc.).



![Example of a diagram for identifying possible users and subjects for a design problem](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5d9d337b_scoping-users-and-subjects/scoping-users-and-subjects.png)



##### It's time to select a topic! Here are the steps:

Task List

- **Choose a general design space** (if you selected the Coffee Shop app, then this part is already done for you)

- **Dissect your topic** based on user segments or niche market; Go at least 4-6 levels deep, and consider using a diagram (like the one above) to visualize possible users and subjects you could target

- Select a **specific, narrowly scoped design problem** that you want to tackle for your research project

  



## Is it do-able?

The key is to find a design problem you are passionate about, but also take feasibility into consideration. Do you have access to the target users? For example, if you are interested in building a tool for rocket ships, you need to think about how many astronauts you can talk to. And is the problem specific enough? If the problem is too large, you may not have the time to do good research on it.

As you consider topics, here are some specific questions to ask yourself to make sure you've got a reasonable scope and a good topic. Don't move on with the project until you feel each of these statements is true about your topic:

Task List

- The topic targets **a specific type of user**. This should be a group of users who all share the same need or problem. Be as specific as possible (i.e., "language-learners" is too broad; a specific group like "adults with full-time jobs who are learning a language for fun" would be better).

- You have **easy access to your target users**, and you can recruit a significant number of them to participate in your study. When thinking of your target user, try to make it concrete, to be sure you can actually reach the people you'll need to recruit. Can you contact them directly through email or phone? Or can you get that contact information through someone you have a direct connection with?

- The topic focuses on **a single task flow**.

- The topic is something **you can research with the time and resources you have**.

- The topic is **interesting to you personally**.

  

## Validate the Needs Before Designing Screens

you should always validate the design solutions before you jump into drawing screens.

Once you've landed on a research topic, you should not just assume it addresses a valid user need. You might do a great job scoping a problem that targets a specific type of user and a specific need. But that type of user and that specific need might not actually exist!

This is one of the potential benefits of research—you can check whether a need really exists in your proposed users before you jump into designing a solution for that need. When you conduct your own research, you should consider including questions that check whether users really need or want the thing you are planning to design.



## Competitive Analysis

When doing **competitive analysis**, you can compare *features* and you can compare *experiences*.

For **feature comparison**, what you would do is select a list of core features, and then see how each feature works on the competing site.

For **experience comparison**, you might take the following steps:

1. Survey users about their experience with competitors
2. Identify what users care about (e.g., users really value “customization” or “finding deals”)
3. Understand users’ experience with competitors
4. Select metrics (e.g., usability, customization, etc.)
5. Rate each competitor against the metrics
6. Summarize your learnings. (e.g., Users rate product A very high on usability because product A simplified the purchasing process. Our product should learn from product A).

## There are many kinds of competitive analysis

There are many different ways to do **competitive analysis**, and many different questions you may want to focus on. For example:

- Are you interested in learning more about what services your competitors offer?
- Are you interested in a deep-dive on the interaction design?
- Do you want to learn more about how users perceive the competing products?

You can look at direct competitors, indirect competitors, partial competitors, or even analogous competitors.

If you'd like to dive deeper into this topic, I recommend this article about [Competitive Analysis on a Budget](https://www.palantir.net/blog/competitive-analysis-budget).



**It is really important to collect your own data, understand your users, don't just copy your competitor**

This was sort of a trick question—the truth is, we don't really know the answer to this just based on our competitive analysis! Competitive analysis can only tell us what the competitors are doing, but not *why* they are doing it. We don't have access to their data, or even know whether their decisions are based on any data!

In fact, there is some risk that if we just blindly copy our competition, we may duplicate their bad design decisions right along with the good ones!

That is why we need to do more than just copy what others are doing—we need to conduct our own research and get our own data.



---

Remember, competitive analysis can be super useful, but it's not a good idea to simply copy what your competitors are doing. You don't know what (if any) data they based a design decision on. What's more, you may be targeting different users with your product. In the end, you'll need your own data on *your* target users.



Many of today's successful companies take a data-driven approach to creating their products. When you look at any popular product (for example, shoes at [Zappos.com](https://www.zappos.com/)), everything you see on the screen—from the hex value of the blue promotion banner to the name of the button—is probably backed by data.

Just to give you an idea of the kinds of data-related questions you might ask, here are some you could apply to the HotelFinder example:

- What data do I have right now? (e.g., "we collect historical data on the price of a hotel")
- Which data do my users care about? (e.g., "our users always search for deals—so they want to know whether a hotel is lower than usual price")
- If I decide to show the historical pricing data for hotels to our users, how will this impact their behavior? (Will this cause users who have previously booked hotels to ask for a refund if they now can see they didn’t book their hotels at a good price?)
- Why do lots of users not make it through the user journey? (e.g., "why do 60% of our users abandon our site when we ask them to enter their credit card?")



So it's important to design with data in mind. But how do we get that data? In the next lesson, we'll look at some ways to get data about our users through interviews and surveys.

---

## Review

In this lesson, we took a tour through many of the fundamentals you need to have in mind before starting your research:

- We asked the question, **what is good UX?** And we looked at a number of examples of different products and interfaces, while considering what might make them good (or bad) experiences for users.
- We went over **Nielsen's 10 heuristics** and saw how we can use heuristics to quickly and inexpensively evaluate a design.
- We looked at how and when to do **competitive analysis**.
- We talked about the importance of **designing with users in mind** and to **designing with data in mind**.

Although we talked a little about research and data in this lesson, we didn't get into many specifics. In the next lesson, we'll discuss UX research in more detail, and you'll get started on the research for your project.

By now, you should have **selected the design topic for your final project**. If you haven't settled on a topic yet, you'll want to do that now, since you'll be doing research on that topic in the next lesson.



# Research First

In this lesson, we'll be looking at key components of the UX research process, including:

- How to create a research plan
- How to recruit participants
- How to conduct a semi-structured interview study
- How to conduct a survey study, including how to ask effective survey questions
- How to analyze data
- How to create a report

## Taking Advantage of Existing Data

research doesn't have to start from scratch

you can start from other

- Literature reviews
- Industry reports

from stakeholders

- Existing Data
- Domain expert

## Quantitative Studies

The key things to remember with **quantitative** studies are that they typically involve collecting data from a *large number of users*, usually through surveys or other tools that can be administered at scale—and, in the end, the results you end up with involve *numerical data* (e.g., "70% of users click on the blue button more than the green button"). Notice that data like this often doesn't tell us the underlying reasons *why* (e.g., we do not know *why* users are clicking on the one button more than the other).

In quantitative studies, researchers usually collect data from a large number of users, and they generally look at the aggregated, numerical data. They don't look at detailed, explanatory data from a single participant.

Exercise:

Your team wants to send supper important information to users. How should you send the message?

A. Emails
B. Push notification
C. All of the above
D. Other (_)

Quantitative survey methods:

- Surveys
- A/B Testing - Design version A Vs. Design version B 
- Card Sorting
- Web Analytics

and many more...

Quantity studies helps us answer questions such as:

- Who are my users? (where do they live, are the young etc)
- How many users like this feature
- Do users like green links or blue linsk

## Qualitative Studies

Qualitative research allows us to probe and find out why and how

The key things to remember about **qualitative studies** are that they typically involve having *in-depth interactions* with a *small number of users*—and because you are having such in-depth interactions, you are able to probe the underlying reasons *why* the user does something, as well as the specifics of *how* they do it.

Qualitative survey methods:

- Interviews (talk to users)
- Diary study (ask users to keep a diary on how they use the product - probably need to pay them)
- Contextual inquiry (observed how people interact with the product)
- Participatory design (ask users to design with you)
- Concept testing (show users diff concepts and see how they react to it)

and many more...

## Quantitative vs. Qualitative

Let's briefly summarize the key characteristics of quantitative and qualitative studies:

**Quantitative studies**

- Large sample sizes
- Understand the preferences, behaviors and attitudes of the general population
- Result in numerical data (e.g.. "70% of users click on the green button")
- For example: surveys, A/B testing, card sorting, or other tools that can be administered at scale

**Qualitative studies**

- Small sample sizes
- In-depth interactions
- Allow researchers to probe why and how
- For example: interviews, contextual inquiry, participatory design, concept testing, etc.

**Qual vs Quant Usability study**

Note that some research methods can be done in both qualitative and quantitative ways—for example, diary studies and usability studies. Let's consider an example of a usability study and talk about what kind of information a qualitative study would give us, and then compare this with the kind of data we would get from a quantitative study.

Example: Show your design to users to see whether is hard or simple to use it.

Hey am designing this on-boarding experience for the Mophis selfy app, and you task is to take your very first selfy. 

If 4 out 5 participants are able to successfully take a selfie:

- This app is generally easy to use
- 80% of users will be able to use this app successfully

Well five people is a very small sample and also did all participants represent the general population. If you want to conduct a quantitative usability study and use it to make conclusions about a large group of people, then you need to have many participants. And the participants need to represent the population you want to draw conclusions on.

## Let’s Research

By now, you should have a UX topic in mind for your final project, so it's time to start making concrete plans for how to plan your research. We'll spend most of the rest of this lesson going over the main steps that you'll typically see in a UX study:

1. Create plans (Why are you running the study? what do you want o learn about?)
2. Recruit participants (Who are the users? Where to find them?)
3. Run the study (Collect data from users)
4. Analyze data (What insights did you find?)
5. Socialize findings (Share results and influence stakeholders)

## The Parts of a Research Plan

**Step 1** - As we just saw, a typical UX research plan will have these components:

1. Background

   - What is this product about?
   - Which stage is it in?
   - What do you want to get from

2. Research goals

   Why do you want to do a research study

   - Help language learners read and speak better
   - Since this is a new product, I want to identify opportunities 

3. Research questions

   The overarching research questions can be answered by the list of interview questions

   ​	Note: If the researcher ask a user, "What kind of language learning product do you need?"

   ​	"I need the app to be free and have video chat with a real teacher will be great". 

   ​	Nice trial, but a  researcher should know that is not going to happen. Users can easily digress 	and start to talking about all their wishes and dreams that we cannot offer.

   Exampl: Since the language learning product is still in the early stage, our overarching research questions are:

   		- What's essential for language learning
   		- How do learners currently know how to read and speak?
   		- What do  they need in order to improve their language skills?
   		- Do people really need another language learning product?

4. Recruiting

   - What kind of criteria do people need to meet?
   - Where and how do we find participants
   - Are we providing any incentives

   Screener (screener survey sent to users)

5. Script

   **Intro**

   	- Introduce yourself
   	- What you do and why you want to chat
   	- Conversation will be confidential
   	- Users are free to leave the session at any time
   	- Permission to record

   Example: Peace, I'm a UX Designer for the language app. Thank you for participating in the study and today we want to know more about how you study foreign languages. Our conversation will be confidential and it won't be shared outside our team. You are free to leave the session at anytime. If it is okay with you can we record this session?

   **Questions**

Example

Imagine you work for Netflix, and that recent data shows users don’t engage with Netflix as much as before. Netflix wants to know why. You're going to interview 10 users to try to find out.

Which of the following could potentially be your overarching research questions?

(Select all that apply)

- How many hours do users spend watching Netflix each week?
- How do users feel about the quality of Netflix shows?
- What are the demographics of our users?
- What do users like and dislike about Netflix?

Research questions for your interview study should be high-level. "How many hours do users spend watching Netflix each week?" is a low-level question that can be answered in a survey or through web analytics.

Demographics are not usually the focus of interview studies; they can be answered easily enough through a survey (which would be less expensive).

​                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

## Screener for recruiting participants

As I said in the video, you can send potential participants a screener survey to see if they have the characteristics you're looking for in your target users. If you'd like to get a better idea of what screeners are like, you can fill out the [Google UX research screener](https://userresearch.google.com/) or the [Microsoft UX research screener](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/usability/default.aspx).

For your own screener, it does not need to be as comprehensive as these examples. You can create your own screener using [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/). If you are recruiting families and friends to be the free participants for your very first UX research project, you don’t have to have a screener.

## Final Project, Step 1A: Create a Research Plan

Now that you have a design problem in mind, it’s time to create your research plan.

## Example

Before starting on your own, check out this [example research plan](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da657d1_example-research-plan/example-research-plan.pdf).

Hopefully that gives you an idea of the kind of thing you're trying to create. Of course, your research plan does *not* need to have the exact same format as the example. You are the designer. As long as your plan includes all of the key parts, you are free to apply your design skills and creativity to customize it.

That said, notice that the example has all the key components we just discussed:

- Project background
- Research goals
- Overarching research questions
- Recruiting plan
- Script

You'll also notice that the example plan is divided into two separate studies: An **interview study** and a **survey study**. You don’t need to write your interview or survey questions now. We'll get to these later in the lesson.



Before moving on, you should get started on your research plan.You can create one from scratch using a word processor or slide deck (whatever you prefer). Or you are welcome to use the template provided here:[Research Plan Template (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3GaCyiqz9rXE3LbfR3OxCDRSRqPKp_OiS7XJ9Unp0U/copy)[Research Plan Template (docx file)](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da65ed7_template-research-plan/template-research-plan.docx)Once you've created your document, see if you can fill out some of the info for the *interview study*. We'll get into the details about how to do an interview study next, so you don't have to get into all of the details now. But you should be able to at least draft the following:



Task List

- Write the background

  

- Write the research goals

  

- Write the overarching research questions

  

- Write how and where you will recruit participants

  

- If you are going to use a screener, write your screener questions (if you are recruiting friends and family, you can skip writing a screener—though even then, it would still be good practice!)

  

- Write the introduction part of the script

  

Again, we've only created the first part of our research plan here. We still need to write our actual interview questions—so let's look at how to do that next.

---



## How to Do Semi-Structured Interviews

There are different types of interviews

- Structured (Has only predefined questions; interviewer doesn't adjust or add to questions during the interview.)
- Semi-Structured (Has predefined questions, but the interviewer is free to add to or adjust questions based on users’ answers.)
- Unstructured (No predefined questions; used for exploration during early stages of research; commonly used in sociology.)



### QUESTION 2 OF 2

Which of the following could be good questions for user interviews?

(Select all that apply.)

- [ ] Would you pay for a video streaming service for only $4.99/month?
- [ ] Where do you do online shopping?
- [x] Could you walk me through how you used Google Maps to mark your parking spot last time?
- [x] You mentioned you really like the one-click to purchase feature, what do you like about that feature?
- [ ] How do you feel about a bigger storage space on the new phone?



## Follow-up questions

Note that you can—and will often want to—have multiple interview questions that all get at the same underlying research question. This allows you to follow a line of questioning that makes sense for each user.

**Research question:**
[User behaviors] How do language learners currently study languages?

**Interview question:**
You mentioned earlier that you are currently using Duolingo. What time of day and where do you usually use Duolingo? [Does participant have a daily routine? Is it spontaneous?]

**Follow-up questions:**

- Ask participants about the context [when and where]: At noon every day? Are they on a short lunch break? When they are waiting for a bus?
- Ask participants why they choose to use the app in certain locations or during certain times

## Final Project, Step 2: Recruit Participants

Once you have your research plan worked out, it's time to start on the next step—recruiting participants!

What the recruiting message should have. Use design thinking to write recruiting email.

- What - the study is about
- When - to meet
- Duration - of the study
- Where - where to meet
- How to sign up;

I know you all have a strong passion for learning languages. I would love to learn about all the ways in which you study foreign languages. I'll pay for the coffe and listen to what you like and don't like as well as what you feel are missing. it will take at most 30 minutes.

I'm working on making an app that will help language learners like yourself. Help me help you. Anyone who interviews will be able to try an alpha version of the app before anyone else

I am available after work at the Starbucks outside of building F. I can be reached at test@gmail.com

I look forward to hearing from you.



An imporved one:

Subject: A free coffee for 30 min chat about your language learning experience

Hello language learners,

I'm working on making an app that will help language learning product and I need your input. I would love to chat with you about how you learn languages.

**When: July 13 to 20, 2019**
**Where: Starbucks outside of building F**
**Duration: 30 min**
**Gift: I will buy you a coffe**

If you are interested, please sign up using this form.  (this could be screener form)

Cheers

Joe





Scheduling interviews and conducting the actual interviews takes some time. For your own project, I’d encourage you to start recruiting early.

For the final project, you will need to interview a minimum of **two participants**. But be aware that you are not likely to get the best data from only talking with two people. There isn’t a magic number for how many users you need to talk to, butfcccccccc if you have time, I recommend that you try for at least **five participants**. After you talk to a few users, you will probably start to notice themes and patterns in their answers. Some people will probably have similar needs or pain points.

## Final Project, Step 3: Run the Study

Once you've got a plan and have recruited your participants, it's time to actually run your interviews and collect data from your users.

Some logistics to think about before running the study:

- is the study going to be in person or over the radio (if in person where should meet. is better to meet with people where they do the task. example)
- tell users ahead time what they should bring with them for the studies
- if you want to do a remote study,record the call or the session
- Start building rapport first, easy questions and kinda get to know each other (Eg how are you, tell me more about yourself, you hobby, what you like etc)
- Silent is okay, sometimes people need to think about an answer
- always probe and ask for clarification if you are confuse
- ask for artifacts (eg can i take a poto of this?)

## Final Project, Step 4: Analyze Data (Affinity Diagramming)

Once you've run your study, you'll probably have a mountain of data. So in the next step, we'll work on organizing and analyzing that data. Let's look at how we can use something called **affinity diagramming** to help use do this.

Analyze **qualitative** data using **affinity diagramming** - it is a method use to analyze qualitative data.

You should transcribe your notes from the interview session into yellow sticky notes. each notes includes which participant and a single piece of information. each note should stand alone. When you look at  a single later, you know what it talks about.



make sure the notes give us context information



## Final Project, Step 5: Share Your Results



Once you've collected and organized the insights from your research, it's time to socialize your findings—that is, to share them with others. If you are working as a professional UX designer, this can be an important step for getting buy-in from the other stakeholders at your company.

### The Research Report

A common way to share findings from a UX study is to summarize them in a **research report**, so that others can easily see the key results of your work.

### Create Your Research Report

It's time to create your research report! You can use Google Slides, Powerpoint, or Key Note to create your report. Whatever software you use, you'll export the report to a PDF when you're all done.



## Final Project, Step 6: Plan a Survey Study

Once you've gathered findings from your interviews, it's often a good idea to follow up with a survey study. Remember, one reason for this is to ask if the results you found with the small number of people you interviewed will apply to the larger population.

Rather than trying to investigate everything you learned in your interviews, you should take the opportunity to narrow down the scope of your study and just select one or two key findings that you'd like to check into further with your surveys.

**Note:** *In this section, we'll walk you through how to both* **plan** *and* **run** *your survey. For your own project, we only require you to demonstrate that you know how to do the first of these two steps—to plan the survey and write questions for it. You can then go ahead and run the survey if you have time, but this is an optional step that isn't required for your project.*

### Plan your survey study

It's time to think about your own survey study. Like with your interview study, you should first plan out your survey before you run it.

So the first step is to go back to your research plan document and add a new section for your survey study. As before, you may want to look at the [example research plan](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2019/October/5da657d1_example-research-plan/example-research-plan.pdf)—you'll find an example for a survey study under the heading **Study 2: Survey**.

Remember, your goal with the survey study is to follow up on a few of the key findings from your interview study, in order to explore those ideas further and check whether they hold true for the larger population.

Just like before, you should be sure to include the following in your plan:

### Run your survey study

Once you feel good about your plan, you can go ahead and send out your surveys.

Here are the main to-dos:

- Copy your survey questions into a service like [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) or [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/).
- Whatever service you use for your survey, be sure it is set up to collect the responses (and that you know where to find this data)
- Send out the surveys and collect the responses
- Look at the data and see if you can find interesting patterns or insights. You'll probably want to sum up any interesting general trends you see in the data (such as, “40% of language learners say they need a personal tutor”). And you can also look at answers from different questions together (such as, “Users who said they need a teacher in question 1 also said they don’t have internet access at home in question 19”).
- Optionally, you can do statistical analyses on your results (if you have a reason to and you know how—again, this is completely optional)
- Take your key findings and add them to your research report



## Additional Research Methods

### Part I: Diary studies and card sorting

See the video

### Part II: Personas and Jobs-to-be-done

See the video

## Additional resources

For your final project, you are free to conduct additional research studies. (For UX research, it is always a matter of "the more the merrier"!)

Here are some additional readings to check out if you want to dive deeper into research methods:

# Design for Humans

In the last lesson, we looked at some examples of how psychology can be used in a negative way to manipulate users, such as through the use of unnecessary urgency and manipulinks. In this lesson, we'll look at how to apply psychology to design in a positive way. Some of the things we'll look at are:

- **Thinking is hard**; a good design will support the user by reducing the amount of time and effort required to use the product
- We should consider **peripheral vision** in designing the placement, color, and movement of our designs
- We can improve our designs by applying principles from **Gestalt psychology**, such as how the grouping of objects affects the way we perceive them
- We can use **emotional design** to help our product resonate better with the user's experience

We'll also get more practice with sketching—and we'll take a shot at incorporating what we've learned into our sketches.



## Step 7A: Sketch a design

For my app, I wanted to focus on vocabulary building, since the data from my study showed that this is the feature my users are most interested in. Below you can see a quick sketch for the vocabulary sets screen, where users are shown a list of vocabulary sets and they can choose which one they want to study.

I'm showing you the sketch for my app just to give you a general idea of the kind of thing we're trying to do—your sketch will probably look very different, since you're designing a different product! You should feel free to be as creative as you like.

It’s time to sketch again.

Having run your user interviews and surveys, hopefully by now you have a better idea of your user's needs and what you want to design to meet those needs. As part of your final project, your goal is to sketch out at least one screen of the potential core experience for your use.

What are some of the interesting findings from your research project? You should incorporate at least one of these findings in your sketch.

Remember, don't be intimidated by sketching! This should be a fun and creative way to generate ideas—and you should not feel like it has to be perfect. You can (and should) iterate on your design anyway. (Focus on improvement over time, not perfection!)

For this exercise, you can choose to draw a single screen or multiple screens. You can sketch on paper or on a tablet, whichever you prefer.

Have fun sketching!

- **Sketch one or more screens** for the product you're designing.

- When sketching, **make use of at least one of the findings from your research**.

- **Take a photo** (or screenshot) of the design and copy it into a word document or slide (so that you can add text next to it). You can use whatever app you like for this part, as long as you can export the result as a PDF (this is how you'll submit it later on).

- Next to your design, explain what this screen is about and what users are supposed to do on this screen.

- Also next to your design, explain which research finding(s) you applied and describe how they make the user experience better.

  

## Thinking is Hard

As humans, we may like to think of ourselves as "the thinking animals". But thinking is hard! When we process information, try to understand what we're looking at, or make a choice about something—all of these tasks take time and energy.

Many human behaviors can be understood by keeping this in mind. As human beings, our users have limited time and energy to think about what we're showing them. So if we want our product to give them a good experience, we need to design in a way that reduces this mental load.



## Text and readability

Remember:

- Users don't read; they scan
- Our job is to help users scan faster and get the information they need



### QUESTION 1 OF 3

What techniques can you use to make blocks of text more digestible?

(Select all that apply.)

- [x] Add headers to paragraphs
- [ ] Apply creative writing skills and use advanced vocabulary
- [x] Highlight keywords
- [ ] Use paragraphs instead of bullet points
- [x] Visualize concepts
- [x] Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- [x] Reduce words

Remember:

- **Choice are good** because they give the user autonomy and freedom, but **too many choices can be overwhelming** and may result in "choice paralysis".
- A good way to save the user time and energy is to **use existing patterns** that they've seen before. They know where to look for a particular feature because they've seen that feature before in other apps. That said, we may sometimes have good reasons for being creative and doing something differently. Violating expectations can sometimes (like when building a game) be done in a positive way that is fun for the user. But we want to do this mindfully and make sure our users really do like it!



## Further reading

If this topic interests you, you might enjoy Steve Krug's classic (and very short) book on usability testing, [Don't Make Me Think](http://sensible.com/dmmt.html).

### QUESTION 1 OF 2

The GIF above is from Bloomberg. What techniques did Bloomberg apply to draw users’ attention to the live TV?

- [ ] People always pay attention to the top right of the screen
- [ ] People tend to read everything on the screen
- [ ] Peripheral vision is very sensitive to colors
- [x] Peripheral vision is sensitive to motion

### QUESTION 2 OF 2

Which of the following design decisions would agree with what we know about peripheral vision?

(Select all that apply.)

- [ ] On a newspaper web page, place a blinking ads banner in the top right corner
- [x] Make an important notification stand out by coloring it to be the only red element
- [x] Place less important links, such as “about” and “News press” in the footer
- [x] Place important information in the center of the interface



Here is a summary of the key design psychology principles you should be taking away from this course:

- Users don’t read; they scan.
- Apply Gestalt principles in design; consider how the "form" (e.g., spacing and grouping) of your design affects the user experience.
- Users like to have choices, but not too many choices.
- Our peripheral vision is poor at seeing, but sensitive to motions.
- Our past experience shapes our expectations.

If you'd like to go deeper, here are some books I recommend:

- [Designing with the Mind in Mind](https://books.google.com/books/about/Designing_with_the_Mind_in_Mind.html?id=woVADVwtL1gC&source=kp_book_description)
- [100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People](https://www.amazon.com/Things-Designer-People-Voices-Matter/dp/0321767535)
- [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3/131-7452031-8962139?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0321965515&pd_rd_r=3bccddd3-89b4-4735-9b3a-215f60876f40&pd_rd_w=0iqZ4&pd_rd_wg=S8ha1&pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&pf_rd_r=7RF4A5ZJ3J3GBCKVNFF3&psc=1&refRID=7RF4A5ZJ3J3GBCKVNFF3)

This is very discouraging to see a red "fail" on the screen.

# Concept to Low-Fidelity Prototyping

## Course Overview

Now let's get a general idea of what this course is about, and what the key concepts are that we'll be covering.

## This course will cover:

- Building customer understanding from someone else's product research
- Identifying viable product opportunities and ideas
- Prototyping product concepts in low-fidelity
- Testing and validating product direction using low-fidelity designs
- Improving product direction from early usability tests

## Designing for Digital Applications

Throughout this course, we'll be discussing design in the context of digital applications—mobile apps and web tools. Many frameworks and aspects of the design process are applicable to other areas of design (e.g., industrial design or process design), but the techniques and skills we'll practice here are most relevant for digital apps.

## Prerequisite expectations

We expect that you have pre-existing knowledge in the following areas.

- Research fundamentals
- Competitive UI analysis
- Understanding of basic user psychology

We've also included a few *recap* pages in this course to help you review some of these concepts.

## This course will *not* cover

- "High Fidelity", Pixel-Perfect designs
- Branding or visual styles
- Implementation/software/frontend engineering



## What You'll Build

If you follow along with everything in this course, then by the time you finish you should be able to **take a product idea from a concept to a validated low-fidelity prototype**—that's what this course is all about, and that's exactly what you'll do for your final project.

In the previous course, you conducted some research—either on the Coffee Shop app or on a topic of your choice. Starting with this research, you'll pull together key findings, make some initial sketches, and take your first shot at a prototype. Then you'll do some usability testing on this prototype, and use the insights gained from this testing to make a new, revised prototype.

Just to give you a rough idea, the overall process will look something like this:

![](/home/ku/www/lab/00-learnings/udacity/ux-nano-degree/resources/screen-shot-2019-08-01-at-12.09.16-pm.png)

## Can I switch my topic?

As we mentioned above, you can base your prototype on the research you did in the first course. But what if you no longer like the topic you chose? If that's the case, you can switch to the Coffee Shop app for your prototyping. We'll provide you with some pre-recorded user interviews for the Coffee Shop app—so even if you don't have your own research on this topic, you can still switch to it for this project.

> **Note:** If you're wanting to check out the pre-recorded Coffee Shop interviews now, you can find them in the project instructions at the end of this course.



## Keeping the project in mind

This entire course is structured to help you learn the skills you'll need for the final project. As such, it can help a lot to keep the project in mind as you go through the lessons—and you may even wish to start working on the project as you go, rather than waiting until you get to the end of the course.

You'll find the project, including detailed instructions for it, in the last lesson of this course, called **Project: Low-Fidelity Rapid Prototyping Sprint.**

## Ideas, Ambiguity, and Risk

Ultimately, design is all about the following:

*Building the right thing for our users.*

But this statement is loaded with ambiguity. How do we know whether we've built the "right" thing? And on a more basic level, how do we even know who our users are? The answers may be unclear—and to make things more complex, these questions may mean different things to different members of the team.

When developing a new product, there are lots of risks. You might find that you're building the wrong product, targeting the wrong users, or simply that you have confusion and misalignment between different members of your team.

As the designer, part of your job is to ensure that your core design questions get validated answers, and that the team is in agreement on those answers. A software engineer will think differently from a sales person, and it's your job as a designer to speak a common language—while defining the problem and steering the ship towards a product that has a good chance of success.



## The Design Sprint

To be successful in this role, you don't want to leave things up to chance—you want to have a good *process* in place for generating and refining your product ideas. And that's just what a *design sprint* is for.

> A **design sprint** is a process for collaboratively exploring, refining, and validating ideas—while simultaneously minimizing risk and getting alignment across your team.

In this lesson, we'll explore design sprints. Specifically, we'll get into:

- The ideal design process—and how the constraints of your situation may make this ideal process impossible
- How you can apply techniques like *Guerilla design sprints* to get the job done in non-ideal scenarios
- How to collaborate with others, including tips on how to hold design workshops
- How to use techniques like *active listening* to incorporate research and user data into your design ideas

### QUESTION 1 OF 2

As we discussed in the video, there are two questions we might ask about a product idea:

Are we building the *thing* **right**?
Are we building the **right** *thing*?

The role that a team member holds (e.g., engineer vs. designer) tends to be related to which of these questions they focus on.

See if you can guess which question each of these roles would focus on:

QUESTION

Engineer : Are we building the *thing* **right**?

Designer: Are we building the **right** *thing*?

Product Manager : Are we building the **right** *thing*?

QUESTION 2 OF 2

Is the content in this course prescriptive? In other words, is this the only way to accomplish design goals?

- [ ] Yes, each step should be followed perfectly or the product will probably fail.
- [x] No, design is creative—and the process creative too. The process is there to guide you through ambiguous choices and can be adjusted for specific situations.





## The Ideal Design Process

### The Double Diamond Design Process

See the video

### Other Challenges Along the Way

*Fatigue and Burnout* - Some sprints will be quick and yield immediate results; others might alternate between research and synthesis for what feels like forever. In these cases, there's a risk that you and your team hit burnout—you get fatigued or lose interest. **This isn't a good reason to deviate from the process**. Instead, you might want to have frequent conversations to ensure the team is still motivated or address why the process is taking so long to begin with.

*Deadlines and Deliverables* - There may be situations where you absolutely must deliver something by a deadline—companies often need to pitch investors or clients, and in such cases you may find yourself crunched for time. You may find that you simple have to skip some steps of the process. When you find yourself doing this, be especially careful to note what biases you have and what assumptions you're making when skipping steps—and, ideally, make a concrete plan to check into (or test) these assumptions as soon as possible.



What are some reasons that might change the Double Diamond process in practice?

- [x] Over budget and cannot recruit more participants
- [ ] Fatigue or loss of interest in the problem statement
- [x] New data or understanding changes the opportunity areas
- [x] Wrong assumptions were made
- [x] Project deadlines and deliverables



## Guerrilla Design Sprints

## Designing Within Constraints

The traditional double-diamond design process can be expensive and time-consuming. When we are designing in the presence of real-world constraints, it can sometimes be a good idea to step outside the traditional design framework, to get creative, and to improvise—to engage in what we might call **guerilla design**.

## Transferring Knowledge Through Role-Playing

Sometimes you'll join a team where there's valuable pre-existing knowledge. The team may have completed a tremendous amount of their own research before you joined, or may have a lot of experience from working with users on related products in the past.

In these situations, it can be helpful to *role-play* with one of your colleagues who has this knowledge. You'll still prepare as though you're about to interview a respondent—complete with a discussion guide or usability guide—but your colleague plays the role of the user. They channel their accumulated understanding and provide answers in the first person to help you build empathy with who you're designing for.



When might you employ guerrilla design tactics?

(Select all that apply.)

- [x] Limited budget to recruit
- [x] Testing a wild idea that you don't have high confidence in
- [x] When you don't have time to follow the process as defined
- [ ] When you have a large comfy budget and a healthy timeline
- [x] When there is a deep understanding of a user persona and you can role-play to build empathy

## Collaborative Design

Building a really well-designed product is almost always best done by a team, not an individual. Every team member brings a different perspective and skillset, and this diversity is not simply something to tolerate—it is an incredible resource that you should deliberately build into your process and benefit from.

For example, effective collaboration can help to ensure you're not designing too deeply with your own bias. Let's say you are building a travel application. If you are a frequent flyer, you might have some personal pain points you'll want to solve. If you don't involve others, you might go down a path that is specific to your own unique experiences instead of designing something that is generalizable to other users. You also may not have the skills to build the product from end to end. In this case, you might miss key technical risks or business operations risks that will limit the project's impact later on in the process.

Collaborating early and often prevents these kinds of issues.

Match the probable process style with the design setting:

#### Understanding How to Obtain Buy-In

Asking the questions presented in the video helps you to communicate effectively with your stakeholders. What you don't want to do is not learn from these conversations. If an engineer you're working with expresses they want to see more empirical, qualitative data, you should probably add some form of numerical analysis to your presentations for the next meeting instead of only including user quotes. I've seen designers fail to iterate on their own interactions, which leads to a strained, distant relationship between the designers who are interfacing with customers and the engineers who are interfacing with code.

## Share Key Progress

Along our design journey, we'll be collecting data to inform our designs. "Data" can be anything, from what someone said or did, to some statistic about the state of an industry. As you watch the following video, think about the types of data and information you can present to stakeholders along the way so that they understand how your design came into existence.

## Running a Workshop

## Facilitating Collaboration Sessions

As you're collaborating, you'll often want to engage your team in a workshop. These are a great way to ensure that everyone's ideas are being shared in a structured format. You'll often find that stakeholders who are not that engaged, will start to understand the process after a well-run workshop. People love to break from their day-to-day tasks to think creatively about interesting problems!

#### Danger of Dot Voting

When using dot voting, be wary of [herd behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior)—where people in a group think or behave differently than they would as individuals. This can come up in behavioral studies (such as focus groups) where many people might verbally agree with a statement said in a group conversation, even though they individually do not *actually* agree with the statement.

In our context, the first person who places dots might bias the group's thinking. If they feel especially strongly about a dot, they might run over and place the dot. Often it is a good idea to offer time for everyone to silently think about where they want to place dots before providing the dots.



*The following graphic is some output from an affinity-mapping and dot-voting workshop. Everyone was allowed to place at most one of each dot. Use the graphic to answer the questions below.*

**Note:** *You'll also often see dot voting referred to as* **dotmocracy** *(this is just another word for exactly the same proce*
